# audio/euc — provenance

Reviewed sound inventory for the player's electric unicycle (`js/euc-audio.js`) and Officer Dorkins' siren
(`js/nemesis-audio.js`). All 17 installed WAVs below are unchanged public-source copies. The local all-eleven
WebGPU/WebGL2 matrix verified selected-bank mapping, native-pitch crash playback and the native Drunkard stumble;
the offline report measured 52 voices. Listening/balance remains owner QA. This is local implementation, not a new release.

## Installed full-roster additions — unchanged source bytes

Paths are relative to upstream `assets/live/audio/`, at the same exact commit above. Hashes identify the installed
source bytes. There are eleven crash files total plus one Drunkard stumble and five shared files: **17 installed
WAVs**. The generated manifest reviews **18** source entries, explicitly marking the CC0 `tyre_offroad_loop.wav`
as not shipped; it is not an extra missing runtime dependency. Source/output hashes and inventory checks remain required.

## Rights and implementation rules

- Copy **only** this explicit reviewed inventory; future source files are not auto-approved. Retain unchanged bytes
  and source treatment. `tests/euc-audio.test.mjs` and the generated manifest pin this reviewed inventory/hashes;
  retain those checks when changing source or installed files. Final full-suite/dry-run counts are recorded separately.
- If a file is replaced, update its row (sha256, origin and licence) and the test together.
- Prepare the selected rider's crash, plus stumble only for `drunkard`, before committing the selection. No hover
  playback, eager eleven-bank fetch/decode or silent substitution of another rider's recording. Keep bounded lifecycle
  cleanup, mute/unlock/visibility rules and existing shared mix. Crashes/stumble play at rate 1, preserving spoken
  pitch and stereo energy. Audio/worker failure offers Retry/Cancel; module download failure offers Reload NYC.
- Pause gates playback, retires one-shots and sets master gain exactly zero; a running paused AudioContext is valid
  and avoids competing unlock/suspend races. Mute/hidden/page lifecycle suspension remains separate. Decoded selected
  PCM banks observed: 652,800 bytes normally, 729,600 Drunkard, 1,305,600 Gnarwheel; no eleven-bank retention.
- The offline report preserves differences from older city/cop mixes rather than claiming all voices identical.
  Approximate K-weighted bus measurements are comparative evidence, not programme loudness/true-peak or listening signoff.
- The owner considers NYC within EUC Thrills' existing participant permissions; this records that position, not
  independently verified expanded permission. Contributed recordings do not become CC BY through copying or branding.
  Generated vocals in Trollina's crash and Drunkard's crash/stumble remain outside the blanket CC BY claim.
- See [the notice](../../NOTICE-EUC-THRILLS.md) and [downstream guide](../../FORK_GUIDE.md) before reuse. Independent
  forks should replace permission-limited recordings unless separately permitted, without misclassifying the owner's
  independently licensed Red/WIM/FloWithZo renders or CC0 layers as contributed rider voices.
- Everything else the rider hears (motor, hop, landing, kerb impact, recovery chirp and rolling tyre noise) is
  synthesized at runtime by `js/euc-audio.js`. That code was written for this fork; no upstream audio code was copied.
- `wind_howl_loop.wav` is the game's only wind: the rider's speed wind (`js/euc-audio.js`) and, once it is decoded,
  the city's ambient wind (`js/audio-events.js` `createWindVoice().useHowl`).
